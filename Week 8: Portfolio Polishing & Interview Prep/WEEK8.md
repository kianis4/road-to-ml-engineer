# Week 8: Portfolio Polishing & Interview Prep

## Goal
- Make sure your GitHub is polished and everything is easily demonstrable.
- Prepare for FAANG-level interview questions (conceptual ML, system design, data structures, coding).
- Plan your continuous learning path post-8 weeks.

## Monday–Tuesday: Portfolio Finalization
**Notebook (08_portfolio_prep.ipynb):**
- List all projects, each with a short summary, key accomplishments, & results.
- Clean up code, ensure reproducibility.
- If possible, create a personal website or a blog post showcasing your best project(s).

## Wednesday–Thursday: Interview Preparation
**Theory & Concepts:**
- ML fundamentals (bias-variance trade-off, gradient descent, backprop, overfitting, etc.).
- Data structures & algorithms (LeetCode style).
- System design for ML (how to handle billions of data points, streaming in real-time, etc.).

**Mock Interviews:**
- Practice whiteboard coding or pair programming with a friend/mentor.
- Prepare short answers to “Tell me about a challenging ML project” or “Design a recommendation system.”

## Friday: Networking & Final Touches
**LinkedIn Updates:**
- Add new AI/ML skills, link to your portfolio/projects.

**Reach Out:**
- Consider connecting with recruiters or attending online meetups to demonstrate your new portfolio.

## Weekend: Reflection & Next Steps
**Reflect:**
- Which areas were most interesting to you (NLP, CV, Recommenders)?
- Do you want to focus on a specialized field or stay broad?

**Plan:**
- Ongoing Kaggle competitions, open-source contributions, reading research papers (arXiv), or more advanced certifications.

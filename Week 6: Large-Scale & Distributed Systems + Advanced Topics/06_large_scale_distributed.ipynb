    "## Week 6: Large-Scale & Distributed Systems + Advanced Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Overview\n",
    "Welcome to **Week 6**! The focus here is on how big tech and large organizations handle **massive datasets** and **distributed training**. You’ll learn:\n",
    "1. **Data Engineering** for Big ML (ingestion, feature stores, streaming vs. batch)\n",
    "2. **Distributed Training & Parallelization** (Spark, Dask, Horovod, PyTorch Distributed, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Big Data Tools**: Spark MLlib, Dask, HPC considerations\n",
    "4. **Latest Research Insights** (foundation models, large language models, or domain-specific advanced techniques)\n",
    "5. **Reflection & Real-World Applications**\n",
    "6. **Weekend**: Mini-project to explore large-scale or distributed concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Industry Context**: FAANG and similar large-scale companies process terabytes/petabytes of data daily. Knowledge of distributed systems, big data pipelines, and advanced ML frameworks is a must to handle real-world complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ADHD-Friendly Structure\n",
    "- We’ll break down each day’s tasks so you can tackle them in **small, manageable chunks**.\n",
    "- Use **micro checklists** and short bursts (Pomodoro) to stay focused.\n",
    "- Celebrate each time you complete a day’s tasks!\n",

    "## 1. Monday: Data Engineering for Big ML\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics:\n",
    "- **Data ingestion** at scale (streaming vs. batch)\n",
    "- Storing large datasets (HDFS, S3, data lakes)\n",
    "- Basic concept of **feature stores** (e.g., Feast)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Before you can train ML models on massive data, you need efficient pipelines for **collecting**, **storing**, and **preprocessing** that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Conceptual Outline**: Write a short plan on how you’d architect a pipeline for large-scale data. For instance:\n",
    "   - Data source → message queue (Kafka) → data lake (S3) → Spark cluster → feature store → ML training.\n",
    "2. **Mini-Example**: If you’d like, set up a small local environment using **Kafka** or simulate streaming data with a Python script.\n",
    "3. **Document** how you’d handle partial or online learning if data is continuously updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ADHD Tip\n",
    "- Instead of deep-diving into every possible tool, pick one piece (e.g., how to store data in S3 or a minimal Kafka simulation) and do a quick proof-of-concept.\n"

    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Training deep models on massive datasets often requires **multiple GPUs** or even multiple servers (distributed training). Understanding how to scale training is critical.\n",

    "### Notebook Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Explore** a distributed training tutorial (e.g., Horovod + Keras or PyTorch’s DistributedDataParallel).\n",

# Week 7: End-to-End Capstone Project (Complex)

## Goal
Build a significantly more complex project than before, integrating advanced techniques and best practices. End-to-end: from data ingestion → transformation → modeling (classical or deep learning) → deployment → monitoring.

## Monday–Wednesday: Project Planning & Data Prep
**Notebook (07_end_to_end_capstone.ipynb):**
- Choose a dataset or a Kaggle competition with enough complexity (e.g., Kaggle Santander or Kaggle NFL data, or a robust custom dataset).
- Outline system design (where data is stored, how you’ll process it, what model(s) you’ll try).

## Thursday–Friday: Modeling & Deployment
**Modeling:**
- Possibly combine classical ML with a deep learning approach.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning, advanced transformations.

**Deployment:**
- Dockerize final model, set up a cloud API, and maybe a small front-end or CLI tool.

## Weekend
**Monitoring & Final Documentation:**
- Show logs, metrics, potential re-training strategy if new data arrives.

**ADHD Tip:** Break each part into “done or not done” tasks. No partial credit—finish each subtask.

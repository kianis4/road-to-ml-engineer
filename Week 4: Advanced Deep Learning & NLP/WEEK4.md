Week 4: Advanced Deep Learning & NLP/CV
## Goal
- Dive into sequence models (RNN, LSTM) & NLP fundamentals.
- Learn transformers (BERT/GPT) at a practical level.
- Explore advanced CV tasks (transfer learning).

## Monday: RNN, LSTM, GRU Basics
**Notebook (04_adv_deep_learning.ipynb):**
- Implement an LSTM for a text dataset (IMDB or a small text classification).
- Compare to MLP performance.

## Tuesday: Transformers Intro
**Topics:**
- Self-attention, BERT, GPT.

**Notebook Tasks:**
- Use Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune DistilBERT on a small classification set.
- Evaluate accuracy, F1, etc.

## Wednesday: Advanced CV Transfer Learning
**Topics:**
- Pretrained CNNs (ResNet, VGG, MobileNet).

**Notebook Tasks:**
- Fine-tune ResNet on a small custom image dataset (e.g., 2–3 classes).
- Observe how few epochs can yield good results.

## Thursday: Additional Advanced Topics (Optional)
**Potential:**
- GANs (MNIST generation) or reinforcement learning (OpenAI Gym).

**Notebook Tasks:**
- If time, build a small GAN or do a minimal RL task.
- Otherwise, deepen knowledge of Transformers (like summarization).

## Friday: Reflect & Explore Real-World Use Cases
**Industry Context:**
- Summarize how NLP is used for sentiment analysis, chatbots, search ranking, etc.
- Summarize how CV is used for object detection, AR/VR, etc.

## Weekend
**Mini-Project:**
- Build a small end-to-end text classification or image classification pipeline with either LSTMs or Transformers.

**ADHD Tip:**
- Showcase your progress on LinkedIn or a blog post—it provides external motivation.

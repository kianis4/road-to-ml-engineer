# Week 1: Foundations & Data Analysis

## Goal
- Refresh key math (linear algebra, calculus, probability).
- Master Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Conduct thorough EDA on real data.
- Industry Context: Understand how data analysis leads to business insights.

## Monday–Tuesday: Math & Probability Refresher
### Topics:
- Matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, SVD basics, derivatives (chain rule).
- Probability distributions, Bayes’ theorem, basic statistical inference.

### Notebook (01_foundations_eda.ipynb):
- Demonstrate matrix ops in NumPy.
- Solve small derivative & probability examples.

## Wednesday–Thursday: Python Data Handling & EDA
### Topics:
- Pandas for data cleaning, merges, groupby operations.
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps).

### Notebook Tasks:
- Load Titanic or Iris dataset; clean, explore, visualize.
- Problem: Basic probability queries (chance of survival on Titanic for certain groups).

## Friday: Mini-Project – EDA
Combine all steps into a short EDA pipeline:
- Data load & cleaning
- Descriptive stats & visualizations
- Insights & possible next steps

### Industry Context:
Summarize how such EDA can inform business decisions (e.g., segmentation, risk analysis).

## Weekend
- Consolidation: Review math concepts and code.
- ADHD Tip: Reward yourself (short break, treat) for finishing EDA tasks.
